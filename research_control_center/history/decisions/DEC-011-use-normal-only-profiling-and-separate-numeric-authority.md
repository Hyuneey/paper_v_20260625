# DEC-011 — Use normal-only profiling and separate numeric authority

## Date

2026-08-19 (`DAY`)

## Status

`ACTIVE`

## Context

Construction evidence and numeric thresholds needed non-circular provenance.

## Alternatives Considered

- LLM-authored numbers
- label-selected construction thresholds
- anomaly-anchored evidence as core

## Decision

Profile relations and derive numeric references from authorized normal data before construction; keep evidence numeric authority and utility separate.

## Why

This prevents labels or proposed rules from defining their own acceptance values.

## Consequence

COMMON-42 runtime consumes frozen normal-derived references.

## Current Relevance

Active and central to current scientific governance.

## Supersedes
